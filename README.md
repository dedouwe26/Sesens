# Sesens
It's a plugin that adds the possibility to find scrolls with special powers.
## Permissions
`sesens.command.use`: \
Permission for using the commands. \
`sesens.command.admin`: \
Permission for using the admin commands. \
`sesens.setStorage`: \
Permission for setting a scroll storage. \
`sesens.canUseScroll`: \
Permission for using a scroll.
## Cycle
To start the cycle, type in the chat '/sesens startcycle'. \
This does require sesens.commands.admin permission; This defaults to OP. \
After this treasures will be scattered in a 600x600 field or more or less. \
In the tomb (that spawns between 700x700) you can find a summoner's stone and \
with that you can re-summon treasures and the tomb.
