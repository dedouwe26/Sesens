# Sesens
It's a plugin that adds the possibility to find scrolls with special powers.
## Cycle
To start the cycle, type in the chat '/sesens startcycle'. This does require sesens.commands.admin permission; This defaults to OP.
After this treasures will be scattered in a 600x600 field or more or less.
In the tomb (that spawns between 700x700) you van find a summoner's stone and with that you can re-summon treasures and the tomb.
